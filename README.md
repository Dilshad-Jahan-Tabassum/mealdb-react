# MealDB-React

Live site link:
- [mealdb-project-with-react](https://react-mealdb-project-dilshad.netlify.app/)




I have used:
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/)
- [Animated Gradient Text](https://www.andrealves.dev/blog/how-to-make-an-animated-gradient-text-with-tailwindcss/)
- [Mamba UI]()


In this project, i had shown all categories in the home page. Inside all of the categories i have added a button to get knowledge about that category.
In browse-recipes page all of the recipes have a button. If any user click to see the details of that recipe it will take another page to see the details. There i have used article component from Mamba UI.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
